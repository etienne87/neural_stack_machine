# Neural Stack Machine


Learning to transduce with unbounded memory [link](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5648-learning-to-transduce-with-unbounded-memory.pdf)

1. Read through Andrew trask's [tutorial](https://iamtrask.github.io/2016/02/25/deepminds-neural-stack-machine/) 
2. Implement in numpy the stack specific layers, use cs231n gradient checking.
3. Test for dummy data, use my cs231n rnn layers implements
4. Re-implement in TF or Pytorch.
5. Test for very long sequence like N-MNIST.
